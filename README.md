# Obsidian Custom Note Width

A plugin for Obsidian that enables you to easily adjust the editor's line width on a note-by-note basis.
All these following options ensure that users have a tailored experience, making line width adjustments both efficient and user-friendly.
To make this task more intuitive and adaptable to your preferences, the plugin offers several methods:

- Employ a straightforward slider or textbox situated in the status bar for quick and visual adjustments.
- For users who prefer to work with YAML front matter there is an option to set a custom width through YAML, allowing you to maintain specific formatting or structures in your notes.
- Integrated commands have been added, which can be executed directly within the Obsidian interface. This is especially handy for users who prefer quick actions or are accustomed to using keyboard shortcuts, offering a seamless way to modify the line width without diving into settings or codes.
